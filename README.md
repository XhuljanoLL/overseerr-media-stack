# Media Management Stack (Docker Compose)

A complete **self-hosted media automation setup** using Docker Compose for **Windows**.  
This stack combines request management, indexers, media managers, and a download client to fully automate movies, TV shows, music, books, and more.

The compose file has some extra stuff at the moment, including Plex (Plex and Docker on Windows are a mess, better install it for Windows), and Monitoring options. They are optional, feel free to configure them on your own.

## Services Included

| Service | Purpose |
| ------- | -------- |
| **Overseerr** | Media request management and user-friendly frontend |
| **Prowlarr** | Indexer manager for all *Arr services |
| **Sonarr** | TV show management |
| **Radarr** | Movie management |
| **qBittorrent** | Torrent download client |

All services are orchestrated using **Docker Compose** for easy deployment and maintenance.

## Architecture Overview

```bash
Users → Overseerr
            ↓
     Sonarr / Radarr 
            ↓
    Prowlarr (Indexers)
            ↓
   qBittorrent (Downloads)
            ↓
       Media Library
```

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop
- Windows 10/11 (WSL recommended on Windows)
- At least 4 GB RAM
- Sufficient disk space for media storage

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Configurations

    Copy [.env.example](.env.example) to .env and adjust the values for your machine before starting the stack.

    What needs to be done before using the compose file is to set up the right paths for all containers. On each service, there is a volume mount (bind mount):

    ```bash
    volumes:
      - P:\Overseerr\Config:/config
    ```

    ```bash
    HOST_PATH : CONTAINER_PATH
    ```

    This contains two parts:
    - **P:\Overseerr\Config** - Windows path on your machine. The folder must exist (or Docker will try to create it)
    - **/config** - Path inside the Linux container.
    So, when a service writes to */config/settings.json*, it actually writes to *P:\Overseerr\Config\settings.json* on Windows. **You will need to change these paths depending on where you want to store all the configs**.

3. (Optional) Change environment variables and ports

    - By default, the Timezone is set to Europe/Tirana, you can change it to your own timezone.
    - Ports are set to default ones for each container, if you have any busy ports, you can change them on the compose file by your needs.

4. Start the stack

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## Web Interfaces

| Service | URL |
| ------- | -------- |
| Overseerr | <http://localhost:5055> |
| Prowlarr | <http://localhost:9696> |
| Sonarr | <http://localhost:8989> |
| Radarr | <http://localhost:7878> |
| Readarr | <http://localhost:8787> |
| Lidarr | <http://localhost:8686> |
| qBittorrent | <http://localhost:8080> |

*(Default credentials for qBittorrent are usually **admin/adminadmin** — change immediately.)*

## Recommended Initial Configuration

If this is your first time starting the stack, configure the services in this order:

1. [Prowlarr](docs/prowlarr.md) — set up your indexers, connect the Arr apps, and point them at qBittorrent.
   - Official wiki: <https://wiki.servarr.com/prowlarr>
2. [Radarr](docs/radarr.md) — add your movie library path, quality profile, and connect it to Prowlarr and qBittorrent.
   - Official wiki: <https://wiki.servarr.com/radarr>
3. [Sonarr](docs/sonarr.md) — add your TV library path, quality profiles, and connect it to Prowlarr and qBittorrent.
   - Official wiki: <https://wiki.servarr.com/sonarr>
4. [qBittorrent](docs/qbitorrent.md) — change the default credentials, choose a download location, and verify the same paths are used by the Arr apps.
   - Official wiki: <https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki>
5. [Flaresolverr](docs/flaresolverr.md) — enable it if you need to scrape indexers that require Cloudflare bypass.
   - Official wiki: <https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr>

You can also use the optional guides for [Overseerr](docs/overseerr.md), [Lidarr](docs/lidarr.md), and [Readarr](docs/readarr.md) if you decide to enable those services later.
